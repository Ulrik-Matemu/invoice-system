    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>myInvo</strong> we collects, uses, and handles your information when

        </li>
        <li><strong>Invoice Data:</strong> Details you input to create invoices, including client names, addresses,
            descriptions of services, and amounts. This data is stored in our Firebase backend.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial Information:</strong> We do not process or store credit card details. All subscriptions
            and payments are handled securely through the <strong>Google Play Billing System</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Basic technical information (e.g., device type, operating system) collected
            automatically to ensure app stability.</li>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>App Functionality:</strong> To save, retrieve, and manage your invoices and client list.</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription Management:</strong> To verify your "Pro" status and provide unlimited invoice
            features.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Improvement:</strong> To troubleshoot bugs and improve the user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>

        security measures provided by Google, including encryption in transit and at rest. While we strive to protect
        your personal information, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.</p>

        time through the App settings. Upon account deletion, all associated invoice and client data will be permanently
        removed from our active databases.</p>
